	"description": "-Lifts all human enemies up to level 50\n-Buffs tier 1, 2, & 3 thralls\n-Reduces the thralls' health to that of the unconverted thralls\n-Also applies to animals, monsters, pets, and bosses \n-Pets are heavily nerfed, and are only as strong as their wild counterparts\n-Boss pets are now just 50% stronger than the normal variants\n-Skeleton have their hyperarmour back again, like in Early Access\n-Skeleton have no armour resistance\n-Spiders are heavily nerfed. Only deadly in swarms.\n-No XP gained from killing creatures. Mainly a workaround due to broken NPCStatsAndGrowths operations in Devkit",
	"changeNote": "Lost everything in a reinstall of Windows, so I went ahead and rebuilt it from the ground up, balanced everything added in the updates, and broadened the scope to animals, monsters, and bosses.\n\nThis took about an hour and a half to make. You're bloody welcome like.\n\nEdit: Fuck off, this took way more time than it should have, to learn how to un-crapify the thralls after that update in December 2019.",
