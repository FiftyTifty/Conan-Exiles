The guides in this .zip file may or may not be outdated, although I do aim to keep them as updated as time permits.

When guides in this .zip file refer to using tables and other examples, I use existing tables to save time. When creating a mod, you should ALWAYS use Mod-Tables and the Mod-controller; a guide to how to set up a mod-controller can be found in the .zip file, and also another one here:

You should also have read the following page before starting a mod:
